  introduction: `# Pizza Recipe
  Hi I'm Simone! I'm not a professional pizzaiolo and I never had any sort of experience in a professional pizzeria restaurant. This recipe was developed based on some tips I acquired over time from lots and lots of resources and tutorials like youtube videos, family and friends recipes. I'm just an amateur who likes making pizza :)

  If you plan to perfectionate your pizza making skills, I suggest to come up with your own recipe and research online watching lots of tutorials and different techniques. For now the following recipe is the one that works for me!`,
  ingredients: `## Ingredients and quantities
The Ingredients you need for this recipes are the following:
  
  * Strong white flour (the higher is the protein in the flour the better)
  * Fresh or dry yeast (no instant dry yeast, just use a normal one)
  * Salt
  * Sugar
  * Extra virgin olive oil
  
### Extra Info:
  
  * To convert from fresh yeast to active dry yeast, multiply the fresh quantity by **1/3**. Active dry yeast must be hydrated in warm water before being incorporated into a dough.
  
  * keep in mind that in order to do a **long fermentation** dough you will need a strong flour this means higher number of proteins, otherwise the dough won't resist the fermentation and when stretching it will easily break!
  
You can use the following web app to calculate the quantities (translate the website to English):

My typical quantities are for 4 pizza "Panielli" and 24 hours fermentation:
  
* 708gr of flour
* 460gr of water
* 23gr of salt
* 9gr of oil
* 0.61gr of yeast
* 1 teaspoon of sugar

That's it!
